/**
 * Transfer-list selection for messages posted from source workers.
 *
 * `postMessage` throws a DataCloneError (surfaced by Comlink as "Unserializable
 * return value", dropping the whole batch) when the transfer list repeats a
 * buffer or names a detached one. Deserializers routinely return several typed
 * arrays that are zero-copy views into one message buffer (e.g. per-motor
 * `Float32Array` / `Uint32Array` fields), so the list must be curated, not
 * collected naively:
 *
 * - each buffer appears at most once;
 * - detached buffers are never listed (cloning a view on one fails regardless,
 *   so we must not create them);
 * - a buffer reachable from more than one message is not transferred, because
 *   detaching it would break the other message;
 * - a buffer is transferred only when its largest view covers most of it.
 *   Small multi-field messages are cheaper to clone, and transferring a large
 *   shared backing store for a tiny view would detach unrelated data.
 *
 * Anything not transferred is structured-cloned, which is always safe.
